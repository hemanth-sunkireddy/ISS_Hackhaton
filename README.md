# theRetrieval_Zone@iiit

Welcome to 'theRetrieval_Zone@iiit', where you can find what's lost, borrow what's needed,and buy what's wanted. It is IIIT Hyderabad's Hub for Campus Sharing. 
Our application provides a convenient and efficient way for users to connect and share resources, and helps build a stronger and more collaborative campus community.

Here are some guidelines for operating this app -
1. First the student has to sign in/up with their College Roll No. 
2. After signing in, the student gets redirected to the home page, from where they can select their purpose of visiting the website.
3. If the student has LOST something, they get redirected to the page where all the items found around the campus are listed. If the item they have lost is present in the list, they can contact the person who has found that item. Otherwise, they can click on the NOT HERE! button which redirects them to a form where they can enter the details of the lost item. If someone else finds the item, they can inform the student.
4. If a student wants to sell/lend something they doesn't use anymore, they can fill the form sharing the details of the item they have lost so that a person willing to buy/borrow it can contact them.
5. If a student has found something around the campus and wants to help return the item to it's owner, they are first redirected to the list of items people have lost. If the item they have found is already present, they can directly contact the owner from the details on the page. Else, they can click on the NOT HERE! button and fill the form by entering the details of the item they have found.
6. If a student wants to BUY/BORROW something they can click on the respective buttons to view the list of items up for selling/lending and contact the aforementioned person for the same.
7. If the student wants to view abut the items they have listed in the past, they can go to the profile page. They can also remove the items they have listed if the purpose of listing them is now fulfilled.
